# CoreML-Vision
End result for intro to iOS at Capital One Software Summit. 

**NOTE:** This project is a bit large because it contains two models (.mlmodel). 

We will be using [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) and Vision which are two new frameworks in iOS 11. The goal is to learn the basics of Xcode and iOS while building a simple Machine Learning application.
